# LMU-Master-Thesis-LaTeX-Template
This is a document that helps **LMU Master** Thesis students to start writing their Thesis on LaTeX. Write beautiful Theses.

This thesis was made in **2018**, all changes needed for formatting your thesis since then needs to be incorporated. However, it's a good first start for all those who have never used LaTeX. In this doucment, I show the commands I needed for my final LaTeX document.

I used the website: **[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)** for this document and I recommend you do too, if you're just starting with LaTeX. Furthermore, you could just import this project from this GitHub page directly, if you log in to your Overleaf first.
