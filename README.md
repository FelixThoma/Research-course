# LMU-Master-Thesis-LaTeX-Template
This is a document that helps **LMU Master** Thesis students to start writing their Thesis on LaTeX. Write beautiful Theses.

I was a student of LMU studying Biology; this thesis was made in **2018**, all changes needed for formatting your thesis since then needs to be incorporated. However, it's a good first start for all those who have never used LaTeX. In this doucment, I show the commands I needed for my final LaTeX document.

I used the website: **[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)** for this document and I recommend you do too, if you're just starting with LaTeX. Furthermore, you could just import this project from this GitHub page directly, if you log in to your Overleaf first.

You can preview this document's pdf [here](https://github.com/amitfenn/LMU-Master-Thesis-LaTeX-Template/blob/master/LMU_Thesis__Empty_Template___Git_.pdf).

Now Felix is in charge and I wnat to use this beautiful Template for my Thesis
